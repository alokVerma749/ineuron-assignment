## Day-1

<details>
<summary>Explain the use of JavaScript ( or What you can do using a JavaScript)</summary><br><b>

Javascript is programming language that can be used as a replacement of any other language. It can be used for fullstack web development.
But originally JS is developed for enhancing the frontend of a webpage and now it enriched with a lot of functionalities(like OOPS, API DEVELOPMENT,ETC)
so that it used for `fullstack web-development`.

<summary>What is the difference between client-side and server-side?</summary><br><b>

Whatever this is happening on the users computer(i.e. HTML and CSS displayed on the screen, user interacting with the UI) it is called client-side.

And whatever is happening on the backend(on the servers like: Handling requests and sending responses, managing database, etc) is callend backend.

<details>
<summary> What is Nodejs?</summary><br><b>
  
Nodejs is runtime environment for the JS. It runs on the `v8 engine` and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. 
  
Previously JS can be run inside the browsers because a engine is inbuild inside the the browsers which executes the JS.
It was used only inside the browsers because at that time JS is meant to be used only for only frontend purpose.
But some folks made a decision to take out the JS engine(i.e V8 frome chrome browser) from the browser and enhance it enough so
that it can be used on the machines without the browser. And now it is used on the servers as a backend scripting language.

<details>
<summary>Explain Scope in JavaScript ?</summary><br><b>

   Scope can be considered as the boundary till which something will be applicable or have its existance.

In JS for every variable, function and object there exists a scope linked with it, apart from where they are not reachable.

   ### e.g: -

  ```bash
        let a = "Can be reachable throughout whole code";

          {
            let b = "Can be reachable only inside this scope";
          }
```
  
> NOTE: If instead of using `let` we use `var` keyword for declaring the varibles.Then the varible declared using `var`
>  keyword can be accessed everywhere, this is because the scope of the variables declared using "var" have global scope.
>  While `let` allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement.
