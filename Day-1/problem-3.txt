Problem-3: What is Nodejs?

Solution: 

Nodejs is runtime environment for the JS. It runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Previously JS can be run inside the browsers because a engine is inbuild inside the the browsers which executes the JS. It was used only inside the browsers because at that time JS is meant to be used only for only frontend purpose. But some folks made a decision to take out the JS engine(i.e V8 frome chrome browser) from the browser and enhance it enough so that it can be used on the machines without the browser. And now it is used on the servers as a backend scripting language.
