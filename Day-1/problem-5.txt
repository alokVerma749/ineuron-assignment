Problem-5: JavaScript is asynchronous or synchronous.

Solution: JavaScript shows both synchronous and asynchronous behaviour.

If less time consuming task is executing then the execution will be done in synchronous manner,
but if a more time consuming task kicks in the stack then JS starts showing its asynchronous behaviour.

Most asynchronous JavaScript operations has two primary triggers i.e.WebAPI's and promises.
