Problem-7: Explain DOM in your own word.

Solution: DOM(Document Object Model) is not a programming language. It is a API used by JS to convert the web document int nodes and objects so that it becomes easy to interact with the web page using a programming language.

In simple words DOM provides object-oriented representation of the web pageand allows web page to be manipulated.
