Problem-5: What is “use Strict” in JavaScript?

Solution: Strict Mode is new feature in JavaScript introduced in ES5, which 
allows to execute a function or script in Strict Mode.

This Mode can be applied by just adding "use strict" in the beginning of function 
or a script.

This mode can be used to write safe code. 

1. Using "Strict Mode" prohibits use of syntaxes which later going to be introduced in EcmaScript.
    e.g. It doesn't allows to use 'arguments', 'eval', 'with' keywords to use as an identifier.

2. "Strict Mode" eliminates some JS silent errors and throws error.
    e.g. Instead of creating a new global variable it throws error if an undeclared variable/mistyped variable
    is assigned a value.

3. It prohibits or throws error when unsafe action is taken.
e.g: This mode doesn't allow to gain access over global objects.
